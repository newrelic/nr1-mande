## Getting started

1. Ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. If you're unsure whether you have one or both of them installed, run the following command. (If you have them installed these commands will return a version number, if not, the commands won't be recognized.)

   ```bash
   git --version
   npm -v
   ```

2. Install the [New Relic One CLI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) by going to [this link](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) and following the instructions (5 minutes or less) to install and set up your New Relic development environment.

3. Run the following command to clone this repository and run the code locally against your New Relic data:

   ```bash
   nr1 nerdpack:clone -r https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nr1-mande.git
   cd nr1-mande
   nr1 nerdpack:serve
   ```

Visit [https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local](https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), navigate to the Nerdpack, and :sparkles:
